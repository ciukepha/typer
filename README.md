#typer, a yourls prank plugin

If you want to send a short link why not let the other person do something for getting the log URL.
Just trail your generated shortlink with an underline _ and the visitor will get a page like this: http://5th.li/typer_

##Installation
just create a folder named `typer` in user/plugins/ of your yourls Installation and put the file `plugin.php`.
